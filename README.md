# 👋 Hey, I'm **Erwan LENHARD**

👨‍💻 **Lead Developer / Part-Time Teacher**  
💡 Focused on **Craftsmanship**, **Continuous Learning**, and **Pedagogy**

<br/>

## 🧭 About Me

I split my time between **leading development teams** and **teaching computer science**.
In both roles, I pursue the same goal — **write code that makes sense**, and **share what makes it meaningful**.

I don’t just teach syntax or frameworks; I aim to **transmit the passion for computing as a whole**, from its logic to its ecosystem.
Because good developers don’t just know how things work — they know **why** they work that way.

## ⚙️ Preferred Tech Stack

| Domain         | Technologies                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------|
| **Core Stack** | Node.js, TypeScript, React, Express |
| **API & Docs** | RESTful APIs, OpenAPI               |
| **DevOps**     | Git, Docker                         |

> Typed JavaScript, clear architecture, and automation — that’s where I feel at home.

<br/>

## 🧩 Also Using (Because Work Needs It)

* Java (Spring Boot)
* Angular
* PL/SQL
* Legacy integration tools that make life... interesting.

<br/>

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

* 🧱 **Hexagonal Architecture**, **DDD**, **TDD**, **Clean Architecture**
  > refining how I think about boundaries, domains, and tests
* ☕ **Kotlin**, exploring its ecosystem and JVM synergy
* 🦀 **Rust**, for systems programming and performance

<br/>

## 💭 Philosophy

* 🧠 **Continuous learning** — the best developers are always students.
* 🔧 **Craftsmanship** — good code is built with care and intention.
* 🧑‍🏫 **Pedagogy** — teaching is the best way to understand deeply.
* 🐧 **Open Source** — knowledge should circulate freely.
* 💻 **Environment** — Linux (Debian + KDE) remains my comfort zone.
